This program works in all configurations but it is recommended that it is run in Release mode on x64.

The object of this game is to knock all of the balls off of the platforms. When the balls touch the floor they will dissapear. Once all of the balls are gone, you win the game.

You can control your ball by holding down the 'ctrl' key and using the standard 'WASD' keys for movement.
